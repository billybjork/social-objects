# Multi-Tenancy Feasibility Audit for Pavoi

*Audit Date: January 2026*
*Updated: February 2026 — revised auth strategy (magic links via Phoenix 1.8), added multi-brand switcher UX, refined implementation phases*

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** The Pavoi codebase is approximately **40-50% ready** for multi-tenancy. A foundational `brands` table exists with proper relationships to products, product sets, and creators. However, the application layer doesn't enforce tenant isolation, authentication is a single shared password, and all external API integrations assume a single brand.

**Feasibility:** Converting to multi-tenant is **feasible but requires significant work** across database, authentication, routing, and external integrations.

**Key design decisions (updated):**
- **Authentication:** Magic link (passwordless) login using Phoenix 1.8's built-in `mix phx.gen.auth` generator — no custom auth code needed
- **Multi-brand access:** Users can belong to multiple brands (e.g., "Pavoi Active" and "Pavoi Jewelry") and switch between them via a top-level brand switcher in the nav bar
- **Routing:** Path-based (`/b/:brand_slug/...`) with brand context resolved from URL

## Requirements (Confirmed)

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| **TikTok App Strategy** | Shared App - brands OAuth into your existing TikTok app |
| **Feature Scope** | All features ideally; Product Sets + Products + Streams priority |
| **Onboarding Model** | Self-service (aim for it) |
| **Data Isolation** | Complete isolation - NO shared creators |

### Implications of Complete Isolation
Since complete data isolation was chosen (not shared creators), this **simplifies** some aspects:
- Each brand has their own creators - no junction table complexity
- No cross-brand data leakage concerns
- Simpler authorization (just check `brand_id` matches)

But requires:
- `creators` table needs `brand_id` FK (currently global)
- Remove/repurpose `brand_creators` junction table
- All creator-related queries must scope by brand

---

## 1. Database Schema Assessment

### Already Multi-Tenant Ready (9 tables)
| Table | Isolation Method |
|-------|-----------------|
| `brands` | Root tenant table |
| `products` | Direct `brand_id` FK |
| `product_images` | Via `products.brand_id` |
| `product_variants` | Via `products.brand_id` |
| `product_sets` | Direct `brand_id` FK |
| `product_set_products` | Via `product_sets.brand_id` |
| `product_set_states` | Via `product_sets.brand_id` |
| `brand_creators` | Junction table (brand ↔ creator) |
| `creator_tags` | Direct `brand_id` FK |

### Needs Brand Isolation (Critical)
| Table | Issue | Fix Required |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| `tiktok_streams` | No `brand_id`, optional `product_set_id` | Add `brand_id` FK |
| `tiktok_comments` | Inherits from streams | Depends on streams fix |
| `tiktok_stream_stats` | Inherits from streams | Depends on streams fix |
| `tiktok_shop_auth` | **SINGLETON** - single global record (enforced by `Repo.one/1` + upsert in code, not by DB constraint; the migration's unique index on `id` is redundant with the PK) | Complete redesign to per-brand auth |
| `outreach_logs` | No `brand_id` | Add `brand_id` FK |
| `email_templates` | Global templates | Add `brand_id` FK |
| `system_settings` | Global key-value store | Add namespacing |

### Needs Brand Isolation (Creators)
Since complete isolation was chosen, creators must be brand-scoped:
- `creators` - Currently global, needs `brand_id` FK added
- `creator_videos` - Needs `brand_id` FK (inherits from creator)
- `creator_performance_snapshots` - Needs `brand_id` FK
- `creator_purchases` - Needs `brand_id` FK
- `brand_creators` junction table - Can be removed (no longer needed)

This is cleaner than shared creators but requires more migration work.

---

## 2. External API Integrations

### TikTok Shop API (CRITICAL)
**Current:** Single TikTok "app" with credentials in environment variables
- `TTS_APP_KEY`, `TTS_APP_SECRET`, `TTS_SERVICE_ID` → all global
- `tiktok_shop_auth` table has a redundant unique index on `id` (already a PK); singleton is enforced in application code via `Repo.one(Auth)` + upsert pattern in `store_tokens/1`
- Token refresh worker assumes one auth

**Recommended: Shared App Model**
- TikTok app credentials (`TTS_APP_KEY`, `TTS_APP_SECRET`) stay in env vars (one app, multiple authorized shops)
- Each brand completes OAuth → gets their own `access_token`/`refresh_token`
- Store tokens in `tiktok_shop_auth` with `brand_id` FK
- Remove singleton pattern (both the redundant unique index and the `Repo.one/1` calls)

**Implementation:**
```elixir
# Migration: Add brand_id to tiktok_shop_auth
alter table(:tiktok_shop_auth) do
  add :brand_id, references(:brands, on_delete: :delete_all), null: false
end
drop unique_index(:tiktok_shop_auth, [:id])  # Remove redundant unique index
create unique_index(:tiktok_shop_auth, [:brand_id])  # One auth per brand

# Update TiktokShop module to accept brand_id
def get_auth(brand_id) do
  Repo.get_by(Auth, brand_id: brand_id)
end
```

**OAuth Flow for Brand Onboarding (Critical: bind callback to brand via `state`):**
1. Brand clicks "Connect TikTok Shop" in settings
2. Generate a CSRF `state` token, store a `{state → brand_id}` mapping server-side
3. Redirect to TikTok OAuth: `services.us.tiktokshop.com/open/authorize?service_id=...&state=<token>` (US) or `services.tiktokshop.com/open/authorize?...` (Global)
4. TikTok redirects back to `/tiktok/callback` with `auth_code` + `state`
5. Look up `brand_id` from the `state` mapping, exchange code for tokens, store with `brand_id`

> **Note:** The TikTok Shop Owner account (not just an admin/sub-account) must perform the authorization. Only the main account holder has authority to authorize third-party apps. The shop region (US vs Global) determines which authorization URL to use.

### BigQuery
**Current:** Single project/dataset via environment variables
**Fix:** Store credentials per-brand in database table, or use single project with brand-namespaced tables

### Shopify
**Current:** Single store credentials in env vars
**Fix:** Each brand links their own Shopify store via OAuth flow

### Slack, SendGrid, OpenAI
**Current:** Global API keys
**Fix:** Either share (with brand metadata in payloads) or store per-brand credentials

---

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

### Current State
- **No user system** - single `SITE_PASSWORD` env var
- Anyone with password sees ALL brands/data
- No roles, permissions, or user-brand relationships

### Strategy: Magic Link Auth via Phoenix 1.8 Generator

Phoenix 1.8 (already in use — the project is on 1.8.1) ships with `mix phx.gen.auth` that generates **magic link authentication by default**. This eliminates the need to build auth from scratch.

**Generate with:**
```bash
mix phx.gen.auth Accounts User users --live
```

This creates ~15-20 files including:
- `User` schema (email, hashed_password nullable, confirmed_at)
- `UserToken` schema (hashed tokens, contexts: "session"/"login"/"change:email")
- `Accounts` context with all auth functions
- `Accounts.Scope` module for wrapping current user in assigns
- `UserLive.Login` / `UserLive.Registration` / `UserLive.Confirmation` LiveViews
- `UserSessionController` for session management (magic link POST + logout)
- `UserAuth` plug module with `on_mount` hooks for LiveView auth
- `UserNotifier` for sending magic link emails (uses Swoosh, already configured in the project)
- Migration for `users` and `users_tokens` tables

**Magic link flow (generated by Phoenix):**
1. User enters email on login page
2. System generates a SHA-256-hashed token, stores hash in `users_tokens`, emails the raw token as a URL
3. User clicks the link → lands on confirmation LiveView
4. User clicks "Confirm" → form POSTs to `UserSessionController` which verifies token, creates session
5. Token expires after 15 minutes; token is single-use (deleted on verification)

**Post-generation cleanup (magic-link-only):**
- Remove password fields from the login form (keep magic link only)
- Remove "set password" from settings page (or keep as optional)
- The `hashed_password` column remains nullable — magic-link-only users simply never set one

### Additional Auth Requirements (Beyond Generator)

1. **User-Brand relationship:** `user_brands` junction table with `role` (owner/admin/viewer)
2. **Brand authorization plug/hook:**
   - `on_mount :set_brand` — resolve brand from URL slug, assign to socket
   - `on_mount :require_brand_access` — verify user has access to the resolved brand
3. **Extend `Accounts.Scope`** to include `current_brand` alongside `current_user`

---

## 4. Routing Architecture

### Current Routes (No Brand Context)
```
/product-sets                    → shows ALL product sets
/product-sets/:id/host           → host view (full-page, no nav)
/product-sets/:id/controller     → controller view (full-page, no nav)
/streams                         → shows ALL streams
/creators                        → shows ALL creators
/templates/new, /templates/:id   → email template editor
/readme                          → docs
```

### Recommended: Path-Based Multi-Tenancy
```
/b/:brand_slug/product-sets              → brand's product sets
/b/:brand_slug/product-sets/:id/host     → host view (scoped)
/b/:brand_slug/product-sets/:id/controller → controller view (scoped)
/b/:brand_slug/streams                   → brand's streams
/b/:brand_slug/creators                  → brand's creators
/b/:brand_slug/templates/...             → brand's email templates
/b/:brand_slug/settings                  → brand settings (NEW)
```

**Why path-based over subdomains:**
- Simpler SSL (one cert vs wildcard)
- Easier development/testing
- No DNS changes needed
- Bookmarkable — you can share a link to a specific brand's view
- Brand context is explicit in the URL, reducing confusion when switching

### Implementation Pattern
```elixir
# router.ex — brand-scoped routes inside an authenticated live_session
live_session :authenticated,
  on_mount: [
    {PavoiWeb.UserAuth, :require_authenticated},
    {PavoiWeb.BrandAuth, :set_brand},
    {PavoiWeb.BrandAuth, :require_brand_access}
  ] do
  scope "/b/:brand_slug", PavoiWeb do
    live "/product-sets", ProductSetsLive.Index
    live "/product-sets/:id/host", ProductSetHostLive.Index
    live "/streams", TiktokLive.Index
    live "/creators", CreatorsLive.Index
    # ...
  end
end

# Root "/" redirects to user's default brand
get "/", PageController, :redirect_to_brand
```

### Login → Brand Resolution Flow
1. User clicks magic link → session created → redirected to `/`
2. `PageController.redirect_to_brand` looks up user's brands
3. If one brand → redirect to `/b/:slug/product-sets`
4. If multiple brands → redirect to `/b/:first_slug/product-sets` (brand switcher available in nav)
5. If no brands → show "no brands" page or onboarding flow

## 4a. Brand Switcher UX

Users who belong to multiple brands (e.g., "Pavoi Active" and "Pavoi Jewelry") need an elegant way to switch between them without merging data into a single interface.

### Design: Nav Bar Brand Dropdown

A dropdown selector in the nav bar, positioned to the left of the page tabs (Product Sets / Streams / Creators):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Logo]  [▼ Pavoi Active]  Product Sets | Streams | Creators  [⋮] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Behavior:**
- Dropdown shows all brands the user has access to
- Current brand is displayed with a check mark or highlight
- Selecting a different brand navigates to the same page type under the new brand slug
  - e.g., clicking "Pavoi Jewelry" while on `/b/pavoi-active/streams` → navigates to `/b/pavoi-jewelry/streams`
- If user only has one brand, the dropdown is hidden (or shown as static text)

**Implementation:**
- The brand list comes from the user's `user_brands` associations, loaded once on mount
- Brand switcher is a component in `nav_tabs` that receives `@current_brand` and `@user_brands`
- Switching brands is a simple `navigate` to the new URL — no state to transfer

```elixir
# In nav_tabs component
attr :current_brand, :map, required: true
attr :user_brands, :list, default: []

# Brand switcher dropdown
<div :if={length(@user_brands) > 1} class="relative">
  <button phx-click={toggle_brand_menu()}>
    <%= @current_brand.name %> ▾
  </button>
  <div class="dropdown-menu">
    <.link :for={ub <- @user_brands}
      navigate={brand_switch_path(@current_page, ub.brand)}>
      <%= ub.brand.name %>
    </.link>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 5. Hardcoded References

**223 occurrences** of "Pavoi"/"pavoi" found:

### Must Change for Multi-Tenancy
| Location | Reference | Fix |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| `config/config.exs:71` | `accounts: ["pavoi"]` | Move to brand settings |
| `lib/pavoi/communications/email.ex` | `from_name: "Pavoi"` | Read from brand |
| `lib/pavoi/stream_report.ex` | `app.pavoi.com` URLs | Build from brand settings |
| `lib/pavoi_web/components/layouts/root.html.heex` | `<title>Pavoi</title>` | Dynamic brand name |
| `lib/pavoi_web/controllers/auth_html/login.html.heex` | "Pavoi" heading | Generic or brand-specific |
| `lib/pavoi/workers/tiktok_sync_worker.ex:472` | `get_or_create_tiktok_brand` hardcodes slug `"pavoi"` and name `"PAVOI"` | Accept `brand_id` param, remove auto-creation |
| `lib/pavoi/workers/creator_enrichment_worker.ex:662` | `get_pavoi_brand_id` hardcodes slug `"pavoi"` | Accept `brand_id` param, remove hardcoded lookup |
| `lib/pavoi/workers/bigquery_order_sync_worker.ex:111` | Hardcoded BigQuery project `data-459112` and dataset `pavoi_4980_prod_staging` in SQL | Parameterize project/dataset per brand or via config |

### Can Keep (Module Names)
- `Pavoi.*` and `PavoiWeb.*` module prefixes (81 occurrences)
- These are internal namespacing, not user-facing

---

## 6. Recommended Multi-Tenancy Strategy

Based on research of Phoenix best practices:

### Data Isolation: Foreign Key Approach (Recommended)
- Add `brand_id` FK to ALL tables needing isolation
- Scope all queries with `where: [brand_id: ^brand_id]`
- **Not** schema-per-tenant (overkill for this use case)

**Why foreign key approach works:**
- Complete isolation - no shared data needed
- Simpler migrations (one schema, just add FKs)
- Existing pattern partially implemented
- Easier to query across brands for admin purposes if ever needed

### Query Scoping Pattern
```elixir
# In context modules — brand_id is always required (not optional)
def list_products(brand_id) do
  Product
  |> where([p], p.brand_id == ^brand_id)
  |> Repo.all()
end

def list_product_sets_with_details(brand_id) do
  ProductSet
  |> where([ps], ps.brand_id == ^brand_id)
  |> preload([:brand, product_set_products: :product])
  |> Repo.all()
end
```

### LiveView Pattern (Phoenix 1.8 `on_mount` hooks)

Auth and brand resolution happen via `on_mount` hooks declared in the `live_session`, not in individual LiveView `mount/3` functions. By the time a LiveView mounts, `@current_scope` (user) and `@current_brand` are already in assigns.

```elixir
# BrandAuth on_mount hook (new file)
defmodule PavoiWeb.BrandAuth do
  import Phoenix.LiveView
  alias Pavoi.Catalog

  def on_mount(:set_brand, %{"brand_slug" => slug}, _session, socket) do
    brand = Catalog.get_brand_by_slug!(slug)
    {:cont, assign(socket, :current_brand, brand)}
  end

  def on_mount(:require_brand_access, _params, _session, socket) do
    user = socket.assigns.current_scope.user
    brand = socket.assigns.current_brand

    if Pavoi.Accounts.user_has_brand_access?(user, brand) do
      user_brands = Pavoi.Accounts.list_user_brands(user)
      {:cont, assign(socket, :user_brands, user_brands)}
    else
      {:halt, redirect(socket, to: "/unauthorized")}
    end
  end
end

# Individual LiveViews just use @current_brand — no auth boilerplate
defmodule PavoiWeb.ProductSetsLive.Index do
  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    brand_id = socket.assigns.current_brand.id
    product_sets = ProductSets.list_product_sets_with_details(brand_id)
    {:ok, assign(socket, product_sets: product_sets)}
  end
end
```

## 7. Implementation Phases (Recommended Order)

### Phase 1: User Authentication (Magic Links)

Run `mix phx.gen.auth Accounts User users --live` and customize:

**Generated automatically (~15 files):**
- `lib/pavoi/accounts/user.ex` — User schema
- `lib/pavoi/accounts/user_token.ex` — Token schema
- `lib/pavoi/accounts/scope.ex` — Scope wrapper for assigns
- `lib/pavoi/accounts.ex` — Context module
- `lib/pavoi_web/user_auth.ex` — Auth plugs + `on_mount` hooks
- `lib/pavoi_web/live/user_live/login.ex` — Login LiveView (magic link form)
- `lib/pavoi_web/live/user_live/registration.ex` — Registration LiveView
- `lib/pavoi_web/live/user_live/confirmation.ex` — Magic link confirmation
- `lib/pavoi_web/live/user_live/settings.ex` — User settings
- `lib/pavoi_web/controllers/user_session_controller.ex` — Session POST + logout
- `lib/pavoi/accounts/user_notifier.ex` — Email templates (Swoosh)
- Migration: `create_users_auth_tables.exs`
- Test files

**Manual customization:**
- Strip password fields from login form (magic-link-only)
- Remove or make optional the "set password" in settings
- Remove the old `SITE_PASSWORD`-based auth (`require_password.ex`, `auth_controller.ex`)
- Update router to use generated auth pipelines instead of `:protected`

### Phase 2: User-Brand Relationships + Database Migrations

**New migration files:**
```
priv/repo/migrations/
├── YYYYMMDD_create_user_brands.exs          # user_id, brand_id, role
├── YYYYMMDD_add_brand_id_to_creators.exs
├── YYYYMMDD_add_brand_id_to_tiktok_streams.exs
├── YYYYMMDD_add_brand_id_to_outreach_logs.exs
├── YYYYMMDD_add_brand_id_to_email_templates.exs
├── YYYYMMDD_add_brand_id_to_tiktok_shop_auth.exs  # + remove singleton
└── YYYYMMDD_create_brand_settings.exs              # per-brand config
```

**New schema:**
```elixir
# lib/pavoi/accounts/user_brand.ex
schema "user_brands" do
  belongs_to :user, Pavoi.Accounts.User
  belongs_to :brand, Pavoi.Catalog.Brand
  field :role, :string  # "owner", "admin", "viewer"
  timestamps()
end
```

**Data migration:** Assign existing Pavoi brand data to the existing brand record; create initial user records for current users.

### Phase 3: Brand-Scoped Routing + Brand Switcher

**New files:**
- `lib/pavoi_web/brand_auth.ex` — `on_mount` hooks: `:set_brand`, `:require_brand_access`

**Modify:**
- `lib/pavoi_web/router.ex` — Wrap all app routes in `/b/:brand_slug` scope inside authenticated `live_session`
- `lib/pavoi_web/components/core_components.ex` — Add brand switcher dropdown to `nav_tabs`
- `lib/pavoi_web/live/nav_hooks.ex` — Update to work within brand-scoped routes
- All LiveViews — Read `@current_brand` from assigns (already set by `on_mount`), pass `brand_id` to context functions
- Add root `/` redirect logic (user → default brand)

**Brand switcher component additions to `nav_tabs`:**
- New attrs: `current_brand`, `user_brands`
- Dropdown between logo and page tabs
- Navigates to equivalent page under new brand slug on selection

### Phase 4: Query Scoping (Priority Features)

Focus on Product Sets + Products + Streams first:
- `lib/pavoi/catalog.ex` — Make `brand_id` required on all product queries (not optional)
- `lib/pavoi/product_sets.ex` — Make `brand_id` required on all product set queries
- `lib/pavoi/tiktok_live.ex` — Add `brand_id` to stream queries
- `lib/pavoi/creators.ex` — Add direct `brand_id` scoping (replace junction table pattern)
- PubSub topics — Namespace by brand: `product_sets:#{brand_id}:list` instead of `product_sets:list`

### Phase 5: TikTok Shop Multi-Tenant
- `lib/pavoi/tiktok_shop/auth.ex` — Accept `brand_id`, remove singleton pattern
- `lib/pavoi/tiktok_shop.ex` — Pass `brand_id` to all API calls
- `lib/pavoi/workers/tiktok_token_refresh_worker.ex` — Iterate all brands
- `lib/pavoi/workers/tiktok_sync_worker.ex` — Per-brand execution, remove hardcoded "pavoi" slug
- `lib/pavoi/workers/creator_enrichment_worker.ex` — Remove `get_pavoi_brand_id`, accept brand param
- `lib/pavoi/workers/bigquery_order_sync_worker.ex` — Parameterize project/dataset
- `lib/pavoi/workers/tiktok_live_monitor_worker.ex` — Monitor accounts per brand (not hardcoded list)
- New: TikTok OAuth callback handler that binds to brand via `state` parameter

### Phase 6: Brand Settings & Self-Service Onboarding
- Brand settings LiveView at `/b/:brand_slug/settings`
- Per-brand config: email from name, Slack channel, BigQuery dataset, TikTok monitor accounts
- TikTok Shop OAuth connect flow (from settings page)
- Shopify OAuth connect flow (from settings page)
- Invite user to brand flow (email invite → magic link → user_brand created)

## 8. Effort Estimate

| Component | Complexity | Files Affected | Notes |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-------|
| Magic Link Auth (Phase 1) | **Low** | ~15 generated + ~5 to customize | `phx.gen.auth` does the heavy lifting |
| User-Brand + DB Migrations (Phase 2) | Low-Medium | 1 new schema + 6-7 migrations | Straightforward FK additions |
| Brand Routing + Switcher (Phase 3) | **Medium** | router.ex, 5+ LiveViews, nav component, 1 new plug module | Core UX change; every LiveView mount needs updating |
| Query Scoping (Phase 4) | Medium | 4 context modules (~15 functions) | Mechanical but tedious — change optional brand_id to required |
| TikTok Shop Multi-tenant (Phase 5) | **High** | 6+ files, new OAuth flow | Critical path — most complex change |
| Brand Settings + Onboarding (Phase 6) | Medium | New LiveView + settings schema | Can be deferred until after core works |
| Hardcoded Strings | Low | ~10 files | Cleanup pass |

**Total:** Significant refactor, but achievable incrementally. Phase 1 is dramatically simplified by the Phoenix 1.8 generator — what was previously "build auth from scratch" is now "run a command and customize".

---

## 9. Remaining Considerations

1. **Pricing/Billing:** Any metering or usage tracking needed per brand? (e.g., number of sessions, streams captured)

2. **Admin Access:** Do you (as the platform owner) need a super-admin view to see all brands' data?

3. **TikTok App Approval:** Your TikTok app may need additional approval to support multiple shops. Check TikTok developer portal requirements.

4. **Existing Pavoi Data:** How to handle existing data during migration? Keep as "Pavoi" brand, or something else?

5. **Domain Strategy:** Will other brands use `app.pavoi.com/b/theirbrand` or would they eventually want custom domains?

---

## 11. Bottom Line Assessment

**Is multi-tenancy feasible?** Yes.

**Biggest simplification since initial audit:** Phoenix 1.8's built-in `mix phx.gen.auth` generates magic link authentication out of the box. This turns "build auth from scratch" (previously the #2 challenge) into "run a generator and customize." The project already has Swoosh configured for email delivery.

**Biggest remaining challenges:**
1. TikTok Shop singleton redesign → per-brand auth (critical path)
2. Updating all LiveViews + context modules to scope by brand (mechanical but touches many files)
3. Removing hardcoded "PAVOI" brand assumptions in workers (`tiktok_sync_worker`, `creator_enrichment_worker`, `bigquery_order_sync_worker`)
4. Brand switcher UX (new UI component, but straightforward)

**Risk mitigation:**
- Implement incrementally (don't try to do everything at once)
- Phase 1 (auth) can be deployed independently — it replaces the site password without changing data access patterns
- Phase 2-3 (user-brands + routing + switcher) are the core multi-tenancy enablers
- Phase 4-5 (query scoping + TikTok) complete the isolation
- Keep existing routes working during transition via redirects

**Recommended first step:** Run `mix phx.gen.auth Accounts User users --live`, customize for magic-link-only, deploy. This gives you real user accounts immediately. Then proceed to brand relationships and scoped routing.

**Parallel blocker check:** Verify your TikTok developer app can support OAuth for multiple shops. This is a potential blocker for Phase 5 but doesn't block Phases 1-4.

## 12. New Brand Onboarding Checklist (Team Request)

Use this checklist when onboarding a new brand. Items marked **(Required)** are blocking; items marked **(If applicable)** depend on which features you want active for the brand.

### TikTok Shop Authorization (Required)

- [ ] **Shop Owner performs OAuth authorization** — The TikTok Shop Owner's main account (not a sub-account or admin) must authorize your app. Sub-accounts cannot authorize third-party services.
- [ ] **Confirm shop region** — Is this a US shop or Global? This determines the authorization URL:
  - US: `https://services.us.tiktokshop.com/open/authorize?service_id=...`
  - Global: `https://services.tiktokshop.com/open/authorize?service_id=...`
- [ ] **Verify app scopes** — Before the shop authorizes, confirm your TikTok Partner Center app has the necessary scopes enabled (at minimum: Shop Authorized Information, Order Information, Product Basic, Affiliate Seller/Marketplace Creators). Scopes are configured at `partner.tiktokshop.com` (or `partner.us.tiktokshop.com` for US).
- [ ] **Verify redirect URL** — Your app's OAuth redirect URL (`/tiktok/callback`) must be registered in the TikTok Partner Center app settings before the shop can authorize.
- [ ] **Send authorization link** — Generate the link with your `service_id` and a `state` parameter encoding the brand. The shop owner clicks it, logs in, and approves.
- [ ] **Confirm tokens received** — After authorization, the system exchanges the returned `auth_code` for `access_token`/`refresh_token` and stores them with the `brand_id`. Verify the token was stored successfully.
- [ ] **Verify shop details** — Call the Get Authorized Shops API (`/authorization/202309/shops`) to retrieve `shop_id`, `shop_cipher`, `shop_name`, and `region`. Confirm correct shop is linked.

### Shopify Store (If applicable — product sync)

- [ ] **Confirm store ownership** — Is the Shopify store in the same Shopify organization as your app? Custom apps can only be installed on stores within the same org. If not, you'll need to use the OAuth authorization-code flow instead of client credentials.
- [ ] **Provide store subdomain** — e.g., `theirbrand.myshopify.com`
- [ ] **Install the Shopify app** — The store admin installs your Shopify app on their store.
- [ ] **Confirm access token** — Store the per-brand Shopify access token. Note: client-credentials tokens expire in ~24 hours and must be refreshed.

### BigQuery (If applicable — order sync / analytics)

- [ ] **Confirm data source** — Is order data in a separate BigQuery project/dataset, or will it be added to the existing Pavoi dataset with brand filtering?
- [ ] **Provide service account access** — If separate project: grant your GCP service account `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` on their dataset. Share the project ID and dataset name.
- [ ] **Confirm table schema** — Verify the BigQuery table structure matches expected schema (`TikTokShopOrders`, `TikTokShopOrderLineItems`), or document any differences.

### SendGrid (If applicable — outreach emails)

- [ ] **Brand-specific sender identity** — Provide the desired `from_name` and `from_email` for outreach emails.
- [ ] **Domain verification** — Verify the sender domain in SendGrid (or use a shared verified domain with a brand-specific from address).

### Slack (If applicable — alerts and notifications)

- [ ] **Brand-specific Slack channel** — Provide the channel ID where alerts should be routed for this brand.
- [ ] **Bot token** — If using a separate workspace, provide the Slack bot token. If using the same workspace, just the channel ID is sufficient.

### Brand Configuration (Internal)

- [ ] **Create brand record** — Add the brand to the `brands` table with `name`, `slug`, and any settings.
- [ ] **Assign users** — Create user-brand relationships in `user_brands` with appropriate roles.
- [ ] **Configure brand settings** — Set up email from name, Slack channel, BigQuery dataset, and any other brand-specific configuration.
- [ ] **Verify data isolation** — Confirm that all queries, workers, and API calls for this brand are scoped correctly and no data leaks to/from other brands.
- [ ] **Test end-to-end** — Run through product sync, stream monitoring, creator lookup, and order sync for the new brand to confirm everything works.
